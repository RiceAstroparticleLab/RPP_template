# LaTeX template for Research Progress and Proposal Report

A template for Research Progress and Proposal Report required for PhD candidacy exam by Rice University Deaprtment of Physics and Astronomy.

This template is adapted from a PhD thesis template following [PhD thesis format guideline](https://graduate.rice.edu/academics/candidacy-defense-thesis-submission/thesisformat). The changes include:

- The [top-level structure](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Sections_and_chapters) of the document is *section* instead of *chapter*.
- On the title page it specifies this document is for PhD candidacy, not for the degree Doctor of Philosophy.
- The committee is not printed on the title page, as the committee is not required to sign on the Research Progress and Proposal Report.

This template works on [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com).
