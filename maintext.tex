The main text of the report starts here. The format is rather free. It should be absolutely fine to write something here before the first section.

\section{The First Section}

% This is not a topic sentence, started vague.
Starting with a topic sentence. The first section is probably an introduction section where the background of this research project is introduced. It would be nice to have a little equation:

\begin{equation}
    (A,Z) \rightarrow (A,Z+2) + 2e^- + 2\Bar{\nu}_e + Q_{\beta\beta},
\end{equation}

\noindent no indent here because the equation is not the end of a paragraph but it is not always true. Here what everything mean in the equation should be explained. A figure just like Figure \ref{fig:bb} might be helpful for explaining the equation. And a little citation \cite{Moe:2014ioa} because why not. Now we can have a second equation: 

\begin{equation}\label{eq:0nubd}
    (A,Z) \rightarrow (A,Z+2) + 2e^- + Q_{\beta\beta}.
\end{equation}

This time a new paragraph is started and there is no need to put \textbackslash noindent at the begining.
